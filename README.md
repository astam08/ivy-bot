## Introduction
You know that one **_extra thicc_** maid bot on Discord? No? Well, you're in luck because you're looking at part of her code right now! :P

In this README file, I'll go through a basic overview on the bot's features and commands, how to use it, and then comment on what I plan to add to her in the future. 

**The GitHub repository also has a wiki page, and you can find more detailed information there. I personally recommend reading that over this README file, which is just an overview about Ivy.**

Also, if you're going to look at her source code, please bear with my atrocious coding style. The bot's practically done, but refactoring some code is still a ~~premanent~~ work in progress. I'm still sort of new to Javascript or app development/deployment in general, I guess.

.env file not included for obvious reasons.
