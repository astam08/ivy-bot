## Introduction
You know that one **_extra thicc_** maid bot on Discord? No? Well, you're in luck because you're looking at part of her code right now! :P

In this README file, I'll go through a basic overview on the bot's features and commands, how to use it, and then comment on what I plan to add to her in the future. 

**The GitHub repository also has a wiki page, and you can find more detailed information there. I personally recommend reading the wiki over this README file, as it has more in-depth information might not be present in the README file.**

Also, if you're going to look at her source code, please bear with my atrocious coding style. The bot's practically done, but refactoring some code is still a ~~premanent~~ work in progress. I'm still sort of new to Javascript or app development/deployment in general, I guess.

.env file not included in GitHub repository for obvious reasons.


## Adding Ivy to your server
Just want to add her to your server ASAP? Fret not, I have already deployed maid bot Ivy on Heroku, so you don't have to worry about installing anything on your part. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Go to her Discord bot page (coming soon), then click on "invite" (make sure you're logged in to Discord)
2. Select the server you want to add her to
3. Make sure to give her permissions to manage roles, channels, along with moderation permissions (kick, ban)
4. Click on "Authorize"
5. You're set! You should be able to see her on your server now
